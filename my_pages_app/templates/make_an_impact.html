    <p>
      We are a volunteer led organisation and our ability to impact and achieve
      our target is dependent on the hard work of our volunteers who dedicate
      their time and effort to our cause. We have various opportunities to
      volunteer both physically at our outreach events and virtually.

              teaching but rather engaging the children in variety of activities
              such as puzzles, reading, brain teasers, arts and crafts etc.
