            By the year 2032, we aim to have impacted 10,000 street kids across
            Nigeria and successfully re-integrate them into the mainstream society
            armed with the necessary mental and vocational skills to thrive and live
            independently off the streets. We envision our program will empower them
            and help them break away from generational poverty through provision of
            informal education and life skills that will prepare them for
            sustainable development and a brighter

          <h2 class="col-lg-6">Our Approach</h2>
          <p class="col-lg-4">
            We believe a positive self-image is at the core of street kidsâ€™ ability
            to reintegrate successfully into the mainstream society. Unfortunately,
            the complex circumstances that leads to the kids ending up on the street
            often leaves them feeling unworthy. 
            <br>
            As a result, range of programs are
            designed to nurture and unlock the strengths and talents of each child
            and help then regain their self-esteem and be more hopeful about a
            brighter future. 
            <br>
            Our programs are designed to facilitate self-discovery
            and nurture hidden talents through informal education and recreational
            activities. Children in our programs will spend time each week across
            different activities varying from the mobile learning school to therapy
            and counselling sessions as well as vocational and skills acquisition
            programs based on their individual needs.
            <br>
            Our volunteers and partners
            will dedicate time each week to facilitate the programs alongside our
            public and private sector partners who provide us with access to their
            spaces and resources.
